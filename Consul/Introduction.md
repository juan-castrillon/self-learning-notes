# Service Discovery - Consul

- Applications need to talk to each other. Especially in micro-service architectures where services are connected via network
- Fixed IPs, load balancers or DNS can not cope

Consul is a service discovery tool
- Services regster in a central catalog when they startup
- Application can query this catalog via API or DNS
- They send healthchecks to it
