There some basic text editors for linux that are less complicated (also less powerful) than "flag" editors like `vi` or `emacs`

# `nano`

- Terminal based text editor
- Very Simple
- Provides help in the lower part of screen
- Comes by default in some systems, but not all
- Can be configured (and extended) with the `/etc/nanorc` file

# `gedit`

- Similar to notepad
- Graphical editor
- Default in ubuntu systems (only desktop versions)
