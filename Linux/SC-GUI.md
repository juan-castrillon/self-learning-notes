# System Configuration Using the GUI

- The System Settings menu, allows to perform basic configuration
- `gnome-tweaks` allows for selecting a theme, configuring extensions, control fonts, and set which programs start when you login (among others).

## Displays

- Can be accessed in the settings menu
- Allows to configure display (resolution, orientation, etc.)

## Date and Time

- Linux uses Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) for its own internal time keeping.
- It uses NTP (Network time protocol) to sync the time
