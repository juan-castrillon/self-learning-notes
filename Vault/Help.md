# Built in help

Vault provides a help to know how to configure / what can be fetched from each path
`vault path-help <path>` is used with any path
By specifying a root path, it will give us the overview of that secrets engine. (For example `aws`)
Non existant pats that comply with the regular expressions can also be passed to help
