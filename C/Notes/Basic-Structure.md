# C basic Structure

An example of a typical c program is:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
//one way to comment
/* block comment*/
int main() {
    printf("Hello World");
    return 0
}
```
Important to remember:
- `main` is always an integer function, and should return 0 when everything is OK
- `#include` is a preprocessor directive to include libraries
