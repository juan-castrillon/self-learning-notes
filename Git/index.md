# GIT

Git is a version control system (it registers changes on a file/s)

It is distributed in the way that there is local repositories and also repos in each of the nodes.

> Git uses SHA-1 to reference a version of a file or files. 

## Basic Workflow

git workflow is based on 3 states:

1. The file (or files) are in thw **working directory**, where they are modified
2. Changes (modified files) are added to the **staging area**
3. Staged changes are then **committed to the git repository**. This creates a version of the file (with an assigned SHA-1 id) called a commit.
